A maze generating itself and than solving itself in the shortest way possible using P5.min.js.
The auto_maze is using the recursive Backtracking algorithm(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) for generating the maze and the A* search algorithm(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) for the solving of the maze.  

Both algorithms were implemented using these two [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) streams:
- [Coding Train Live 35: 3D Solar System and Maze Generator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF7DVmovWr0)
- [Coding Challenge 51.1: A* Pathfinding Algorithm - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKYlikFAV4k) (And following parts)
